The sequence of http://people.biology.ucsd.edu/satish/Science/MePapers/korber.pdf[HXB2] was added to map V1-V5 loops to MSA. Additional PDB sequences for later structural mapping are also added.

Using 

----
muscle -in allseqs.fa -out allseqs.afa
----

a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was generated. 

[TIP]
====
Use EBIs online version of muscle to reconstruct the MSA at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/.
====

[TIP]
====
Use Jalview to visualize MSA https://www.jalview.org/
====

= Results

The following MSA was generated and annotated with V-loops.

image::images/gp120-V1-V5-msa-HXB2.png[]


See file seqs.afa for aligment in FASTA format.

- red boxes are V-Loops (V1-V5)
- green boxes are found Pradhan insert patterns
- in V1-loop there are no amino acids from India
- Indian gp120 sequences were only partial sequences


= Conclusions (preliminary)

- no insert from India in V1 possible, since no AAs for India seqs available (partial seqs, 230 aa long) 
- Insert1 and Insert3 are *BOTH* in V4 (not V1,V4 seperately)
- Insert2 could be confirmed to be in V5
